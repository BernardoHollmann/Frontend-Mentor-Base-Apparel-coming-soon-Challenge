# Frontend Mentor - Base Apparel coming soon page

This is a solution to the Base Apparel coming soon page challenge(https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/base-apparel-coming-soon-page-5d46b47f8db8a7063f9331a0). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

  - Frontend Mentor | Base Apparel coming soon page challenge
  - The challenge consisted in replicating social proof section card component for a desktop and mobile view perspective. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page. Receive an error message when the form is submitted.
  - Here it is two screenshots taken from desktop and mobile perspective;

- My process
  - Built with: HTML + CSS + Javascript
  - I had to say this took me longer than I thought to solve it. The desktop design was fine, I used the grid display approach, with the help of the website https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.app/, and It worked. However, I got stuck in the Javascript part, where I couldn't figure out why I was not getting the elements from the DOM. First of all, I learned that the preventDefault function helps to prevent the reloading of the page when a form is submitted. Then, I had to look for the pattern that check if the email is well written. I had to test it somehow and I learned that there is a function "test" that can do it. I have to say that I had to look for that solution online. I know there is a lot of Javascript that I have to learn and I will try to get better in this. The last part was the mobile perspective. It took me some time, but It wasn't hard to do. I just couldn't find a way to better place the submit button in the input element, but I believe the overall result was fine.
